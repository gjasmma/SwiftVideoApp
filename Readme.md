# SwiftVideoApp

SwiftVideoApp is a lightweight video library framework for Apple platforms, built with Swift. It supports metadata extraction, content tagging, user interaction features, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- Extract and validate video metadata (duration, resolution, tags)
- Enable user comments and likes
- Analyze content for geographic mentions
- Modular test suite using Swift's async/await patterns

## 🧪 Tests

All tests are written using Swift’s native testing syntax with custom annotations:
- `videoMetadata()` – Validates video duration
- `videoCommenting()` – Checks for enabled comments
- `mentionedContinents()` – Ensures geographic tagging is limited
- `videoResolution()` – Confirms HD resolution
- `videoLikes()` – Verifies popularity metrics

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repo and open in Xcode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gjasmma/SwiftVideoApp.git
